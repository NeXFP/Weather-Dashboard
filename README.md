# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
 The deployed webpage acts as an easy to use weather dashboard. The user can search for any city on the left hand side of the page in which a display will appear showing 
 the weather for the current day and a 5 day forecast which includes the temperature, humidity, wind and UV index of the location. The UV index is color coded to warn of any dangerous conditions ranging from Green to red. 

 Cities that are inputted by the user are then saved into local storage in which the local storage cities will display under the search function. From the same menu, you may also clear local storage via the clear history button above the city names..
